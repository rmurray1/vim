Changes
=======

- 18/Jan/2015: Removed the annoying ftplugin for html. This plugin was
  overriding the <C-n> and causing problems with nerdtree file tree opening.

- 10/Jan/2015: Added go-vim plugin. Very good plugin to do golang development
  and does all code cleanup and standardization using go tools.

- OLD: Removed Simple Pair plugin, Not much helpful and annoying feature.
